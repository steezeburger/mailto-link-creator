## mailto: link creator
An app to easily create shareable links for autofilled e-mail campaigns.

### Current Limitations
* you'll generally still need at least one placeholder in the email body for the sender's name, something like `[YOUR NAME HERE]`

### Roadmap
- [x] `mailto:` link generation
- [x] link shortening with TinyUrl
- [x] tests
- [ ] custom url shortener
- [ ] a feature to generate a page with a list of links where user can type in name to autofill the entire email body
